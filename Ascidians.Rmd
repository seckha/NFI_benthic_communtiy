Import data
```{r}
benthic.data <- read_excel("Benthic_cover.xlsx")
```

Extract ascidian data
```{r}
ascidians.full <- benthic.data[, c("Image ID", "Image name", "TP", "Site", "Transect_ID", "Transect_no", "ASCD")]
```

Group by time point and site
```{r}
# Summed up cover = how many is there
ascidians.sum <- ascidians.full %>%
  group_by(TP, Site) %>%
  summarize(sum_cover = sum(ASCD))

# Mean cover = on average, how many is there per TP and Site
ascidians.mean <- 
```
